# :robot: CRONTAB Fun

## 🤓 Overview and learning outcomes 
In this assignment you will learn to automate a simple task to run at a specific time using the CRON system

The goal of this lab assignment is for a series of LEDs to turn on at a specific time during lunch in sequence. 🚀

## Circuit Setup:
Create a circuit like you did in the previous assignment and write a python script to make it blink exactly once for one second.

## Using CRONTAB:
Watch the video below to learn how to use CRONTAB to run your light on startup.

Modify your CRONTAB file to turn your light on at a specific time.  Your light should turn on later today at exactly 12:55 and the number of seconds equal to the number of your raspberry pi.  For example, if you have #8, your light should blink at 12:55:08 pm today.  We will line them all up in order and see if we can all make this work today.

## 📝 Next steps
Line your Raspberry Pi up in the back with all of the others in order of the time you were assigned.  If you want to see it work, come back at lunch.
